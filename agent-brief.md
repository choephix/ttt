# Bug-hunting agent briefing

You are hunting for UX bugs in `ttt`, a terminal text editor written in Go, in ONE assigned area (given in your task prompt). You DISCOVER bugs — you never fix them and never edit any file in this repo.

## Hard rules

- **Never edit repo files.** Read-only access to source; your only outputs are probe artifacts in your temp dir and your final report.
- **Always isolate config:** prefix every run with `TTT_CONFIG_DIR=$(mktemp -d)` (or reuse one temp dir for your whole session).
- **Always pass `--size 120x40`** (or another fixed size) for deterministic layout.
- **Never run `help.about`** or any command that may shell out to `xdg-open`/a browser.
- Stay inside your assigned area. Adjacent-area bugs you stumble on: include in the report, clearly marked, don't chase them.

## How to drive the editor

The binary is prebuilt at `bin/ttt` (if missing: `make build`). Scripted interaction:

```bash
TTT_CONFIG_DIR=/tmp/yourtmp bin/ttt --size 120x40 \
  --exec "wait 200; type hello; key ctrl+z; screenshot /tmp/yourtmp/s1.txt; debug /tmp/yourtmp/d1.json; quit" \
  path/to/file.txt
```

`--exec` commands (semicolon-separated): `click X Y`, `hover X Y`, `key COMBO` (e.g. `key ctrl+p`, `key enter`, `key ctrl+k x`), `type TEXT`, `exec "Command Name"` (command palette title), `screenshot PATH`, `debug PATH`, `wait MS`, `quit`.

You can interleave many act/snapshot pairs in one run. Start runs with `wait 200` so startup settles.

- `screenshot` = what the user sees (rendered text).
- `debug` = what the editor thinks: cursor, selection, buffer, focus, tabs, panels, full widget tree with rects. Inspect with `jq`.
- **A disagreement between the two is a bug.** So is a violated invariant: cursor outside viewport, focus on a nonexistent widget, dirty flag not matching status bar, overlapping widget rects.
- Command list: `internal/config/keybindings.go` (`DefaultKeybindings()`) and the command registry in `internal/app/commands.go`. Command palette titles work with `exec "..."`.

Create test files with edge content yourself in your temp dir (CJK, emoji, tabs, 10k-char lines, empty file, no trailing newline, CRLF) — don't rely on repo files.

## Known bug classes to probe

1. **Feature × feature interactions** — a command correct alone, wrong with active selection / multicursor / folding / search highlights. (The two most recent real bugs were exactly this.)
2. **Byte vs rune vs visual column** — cursor `Col` is a visual rune column; wide glyphs (CJK, emoji), tabs, and combining chars are where this leaks.
3. **Click offset bugs** — layout computed in render vs recalculated in event handlers. Click a widget's rect center AND corners; verify focus/selection lands where expected. Known blind spot: synthetic clicks don't activate Changes-panel file rows — keyboard-drive that panel.
4. **Stale state after mode/panel switches** — highlights, selections, or overlays surviving a switch they shouldn't survive (or dying when they should survive).
5. **Off-by-one at boundaries** — first/last line, start/end of line, empty buffer, single-char buffer.

## Budget

You have roughly **20–30 `--exec` probe runs**. When you hit the budget, stop and report what you have. Depth beats breadth: a confirmed, minimal repro is worth more than ten suspicions.

## Report format (your final message — this exact structure, nothing else)

For each finding:

```
FINDING <n>: <one-line summary>
Severity: low|medium|high
Repro: <exact single bin/ttt --exec command, minimal>
Expected: <one line>
Actual: <one line>
Evidence: <1-3 lines, e.g. the relevant screenshot excerpt or jq output>
Confidence: certain|likely|suspicion
```

Reproduce each finding **twice** before reporting it. If you can't re-trigger it, downgrade to `suspicion` and say so.

If you found nothing: say `NO FINDINGS`, list what you probed (one line per probe class), and name the 1-2 spots you'd dig into next with more budget. An honest empty report is a good outcome; invented findings are the worst outcome.
