## File Explorer

The file explorer lives in the sidebar (**Ctrl+B** to toggle, **Ctrl+K E** to focus).

- Directories are sorted before files, both alphabetically
- Expand/collapse with Enter or arrow keys
- Right-click context menu: **New File**, **New Folder**, **Rename**, **Delete**
- Sidebar actions button for **Refresh** and **New File**

When multiple folders are open, each root is shown as a collapsible group.

## Opening Files and Folders

```sh
ttt                             # opens the current directory
ttt /path/to/dir                # opens that directory as the workspace
ttt /path/to/file.go            # opens the file; workspace is the git repo root
                                # (falls back to the file's parent dir if not in a repo)
ttt dir1 dir2                   # opens multiple folders as a multi-root workspace
ttt --workspace project.ttt     # loads a saved workspace file
```

## Multi-Folder Workspaces

Open multiple project directories in a single session. Each root appears as a collapsible group in the explorer, search, and changes panels.

### Workspace Files

Workspace files use the `.ttt` extension and store a list of folders as relative paths:

```json
{
  "folders": [
    { "path": "." },
    { "path": "../other-project" }
  ]
}
```

### Managing Workspaces

- **Save Workspace As...** from the File menu to create a workspace file
- **Add Folder to Workspace** and **Remove Folder from Workspace** via the command palette
- The git branch in the status bar switches automatically based on which workspace folder the active file belongs to

## Tabs

Tabs follow a pin-on-reclick model similar to VS Code:

- Opening a file from the explorer or search replaces the current unpinned tab
- Clicking an already-open tab (or opening the same file again) pins it
- **Ctrl+W** to close a tab, **Ctrl+PgDn/PgUp** to switch tabs
- Right-click a tab for **Close**, **Close Others**, **Close All**
- Tab bar actions button for **Close All**
